        <h2>EFFECTS ON THE VALLEY</h2>
        <p> COVID-19 has changed all our lives in so many ways. The Imperial Valley was
            affected severely being that we had the 5th most cases in all of California.
            Due to the high case rate, we have all been struggling. Some of us lost family,
            friends, or even jobs creating immense financial stress. Our current situation
            has forced education to adjust to online learning for the safety of students.
            Classes that are hands on or creatively based have become harder to teach because
            of social distancing. Socialization has come to a halt leaving people with the
            inability to express their interests and creativity with projects and clubs because
            they have been canceled. Students are having a hard time adapting to the online
            envirnment; thus, losing several opportunies and experiences. This competition is
            our way of trying to allow STEM students to be able to socialize while having fun
            and creating a game. Our goal is to give them the experience they’d originally be
            missing.</p>

        <h2>WHY A CODING COMPETITION</h2>
        <p>Our current situation has definitely changed a lot in our personal lives and our
            education system. One of which includes that sense of unity and socialization that
            in-person school provides for students. At the beginning of summer, I had the wonderful
            idea of putting together a science competition that was modified to our online learning.
            I fell in love with this idea more and more each day when I realized it would not only
            give our Imperial Valley coders an opportunity to be competitive but also give students
            the sense of unity and inclusion online schooling lacks. Since Computer Science competitions
            aren’t common in the valley, I would love to give our coders the chance to test their skills.
            I feel like if students were to be exposed to competitions, they would be more likely to have
            the courage to explore the career path. I am honored to have the opportunity to provide an
            inclusive event to passionate students around the Valley. <br>
